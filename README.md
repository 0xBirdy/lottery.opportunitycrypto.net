As an administrator, you have two options to manage the fees associated with the lottery service:

1) Service fee: You have the option to set a service fee for each round of the lottery. The service fee is transferred to your wallet address, and a portion of this fee, equal to 1/5 of the service fee, is deducted as the "onout.org" fee. This fee can be removed by purchasing the premium version of the lottery service.

2) Unclaimed funds: You have the option to withdraw unclaimed funds from the bank after one months have passed since the last round of the lottery. However, please be aware that a portion of the withdrawal, equal to 1/5 of the total amount, will be deducted as the OnOut fee. If you wish to avoid this fee, you can purchase the premium version of the lottery service.
